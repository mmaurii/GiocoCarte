This is a university project so clearly there are some simplifications and stuff that can be done better.

The game uses Napolitan cards and provides some simple, sometimes stupid rules to simplify the work and to satisfy the tutor's requests.
Multiple player can palys through the same pc and have some tournament or play with a bot that randomly responds with a card.

* To have some clear information about the rules see [Regolamento.pdf](Documentazione/Regolamento.pdf) .
* To discover how to play and how to use the interface see [Relazione.docx](Documentazione/Relazione.docx) .
